You are an experienced financial journalist.  
Your task is to read the following economic news and generate a single, clear, detailed news article covering today's main events.

1) Carefully summarize the most important parts. Use your own knowledge to add relevant context or background information from the internet about each topic and the broader economy.

2) Split your article into **well-structured sections** — each section should cover one news item or theme in detail.  
   - Write at least **5** sections and no more than **15**.
   - Each section must be clear, factual, and detailed enough that it can stand alone as a short news brief.

3) Return your response in **valid JSON format**, structured as a list of sections.  
   - Each section should include these fields:  
     - `"date"`: the current date in DD/MM/YYYY format.  
     - `"time"`: the approximate time in Israel time when the news happened (morning, noon, evening, night).  
     - `"message"`: a clear, well-written paragraph summarizing the section's topic.

4) Write the **entire response in Hebrew**, but keep non-Israeli names, organizations, or technical terms in English if they are difficult to translate naturally.

5) The final output must be **valid JSON**:  
   - Start with `[`, end with `]`.  
   - Each section is wrapped in `{}` with proper commas between them.  
   - Do not include extra text before or after the JSON.

Example format:
[
  {
    "date": "03/07/2025",
    "time": "morning",
    "message": "הודעה מפורטת על נושא החדשות."
  },
  ...
]
